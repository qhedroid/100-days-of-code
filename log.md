# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 8th September 2022, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've started a video watching BroCode, reminded myself about adding images, hyperlinks, formatting and audio files.

**Thoughts** Having done HTML in university, I feel rusty and I'm looking forward to going in more depth and tackling certain aspects.

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the whole BroCode HTML beginner tutorial. Forms, videos, buttons, iframes and more

### Day 3: 10th September 2022, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I have started the first task on freecodecamp, this reiterated everything I learnt in the last two days. We built a cat website.

**Thoughts** we're about to touch CSS now, will go back to BroCode, any projects to help practice basic css and HTMl would help!
