# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 8th September 2022, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've started a video watching BroCode, reminded myself about adding images, hyperlinks, formatting and audio files.

**Thoughts** Having done HTML in university, I feel rusty and I'm looking forward to going in more depth and tackling certain aspects.
